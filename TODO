- Acceleration aids
  * Implement bounding volume hierarchy support

- Benchmarks
  * Hit functions
  * Sample generation
  * Generate vectors of random values in Samplers.hs to improve
    performance
  * Test use of uniformVector instead of repeated uniformR calls
  * Use vectors instead of lists in some internal sampler operations
    (e.g. shuffling using lists and !! will be slow)

- Sampling
  * Make sampler-debug more useful (e.g. take side length options,
    optionally emit sample values)
  * Make more samplers configurable rather than hard-coding in the
    rendering setup process. Done so far: lens sampler, pixel sampler;
    to do next: square sampler, object sampler (currently object uses
    square)

- Effects
  * Refraction
  * Textures
    * Procedural
    * Image-based
  * More global illumination techniques (bidir path tracing, metropolis
    light transport)

- Other
  * Support applying transformations to single objects (implicitly
    convert to instance list internally)
  * Use more newtypes

- Animation
  * animate more things, add more animated value types
  * Support rendering frame sequences on multiple hosts
  * Support showing successive frames in GUI for multi-frame renderings?

- GUI
  * Keystroke to trigger a reload scenes from disk and re-render
