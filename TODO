- General
  * get rid of "batches", re-implement progressive rendering so that
    samples from within a batch get delivered as they are finished.
    E.g., instead of delivering 64 samples in 4 batches of r^2 = 16
    samples per batch, deliver them one at a time at r^2 = 64 samples
  * Support rendering frame sequences on multiple hosts

- Performance
  * Implement bounding volume hierarchy support

- Sampling
  * Make sampler-debug more useful (e.g. take side length options,
    optionally emit sample values)
  * Make more samplers configurable rather than hard-coding in the
    rendering setup process

- Effects
  * Refraction
  * Textures
    * Procedural
    * Image-based
  * Global illumination technique(s)
  * Mesh rendering features
    * Vertex colors & interpolation? Affect material shading &
      properties?
    * Consider triangulation for faces with 4 vertices

- Animation
  * animate more things, add more animated value types
  * GUI: support showing successive frames for multi-frame renderings?

- Scene storage format
  * COLLADA? (or at least a subset of it)
  * GUI: keystroke to trigger a reload scenes from disk and re-render
