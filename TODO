- Acceleration aids
  * Implement bounding volume hierarchy support

- Benchmarks
  * Generate vectors of random values in Samplers.hs to improve
    performance
  * Test use of uniformVector instead of repeated uniformR calls
  * Use vectors instead of lists in some internal sampler operations
    (e.g. shuffling using lists and !! will be slow)

- Sampling
  * Make sampler-debug more useful (e.g. take side length options,
    optionally emit sample values)
  * Make more samplers configurable rather than hard-coding in the
    rendering setup process. Done so far: lens sampler, pixel sampler;
    to do next: square sampler, object sampler (currently object uses
    square)

- Effects
  * Materials:
    * Blinn
  * Refraction
  * Textures
    * Procedural
    * Image-based
  * More global illumination techniques (bidir path tracing, metropolis
    light transport)

- Other
  * Allow user to override tracing depth on command line
  * Make it possible to set arbitrary config settings by using the yaml
    structure? E.g. "world.viewPlane.hres=x"
  * Make console output fancier, improve output of tracy-node (use
    pretty-printing docs)
  * Some settings in the scene are frame-independent, not animatable,
    etc. These should be factored out of the Scene and SceneDesc types!
    This would also avoid the ugly hack in Local.hs where we build a scene
    from description just to get at some of those settings.

- Animation
  * animate more things, add more animated value types

- GUI
  * Keystroke to trigger a reload scenes from disk and re-render
