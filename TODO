- General
  * Support rendering frame sequences on multiple hosts

- Performance
  * Implement bounding volume hierarchy support
  * Generate vectors of random values in Samplers.hs to improve
    performance, test sample setup time in Main.hs

- Sampling
  * Make sampler-debug more useful (e.g. take side length options,
    optionally emit sample values)
  * Make more samplers configurable rather than hard-coding in the
    rendering setup process

- Effects
  * Refraction
  * Textures
    * Procedural
    * Image-based
  * Global illumination technique(s)
  * Mesh rendering features
    * Vertex colors & interpolation? Affect material shading &
      properties?
    * Consider triangulation for faces with 4 vertices

- Animation
  * animate more things, add more animated value types

- GUI
  * Keystroke to trigger a reload scenes from disk and re-render
  * Support showing successive frames for multi-frame renderings?
  * Make depth- and breadth-first rendering configurable
