- Network rendering enhancements:
  - precompute samples on the manager node, send them with SetScene to avoid
    computing new samples on each chunk and creating aliasing artifacts
    (ensures that the same sample sets are used for the entire scene)
  - detect manager disconnection in nodes, clean up gracefully rather than
    getting stuck in the middle of a rendering loop
- Sampling implementations (n-rooks, hammersley, etc.)
- Shading / light sources? Emission material?
- Intersection for
  - triangle meshes
- Procedural texture support
- Image textures
- Area lights
- Reflection
- Refraction
- JuicyPixels for image I/O
- Load scenes from disk
  - Reload scenes from disk and re-render
- Ultimately: want to read blender scenes or a format that blender can export
