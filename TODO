- Sampling implementations (n-rooks, hammersley, etc.)
- Shading / light sources? Emission material?
- Intersection for
  - triangle meshes
- Procedural texture support
- Image textures
- Area lights
- Reflection
- Refraction
- JuicyPixels for image I/O
- Load scenes from disk
  - Reload scenes from disk and re-render
- Ultimately: want to read blender scenes or a format that blender can export
